2016-09-12 @ 1:30AM: It Is Done! 
=============================================================

![It's a small, simple little room scene.](2016-09-12_000_cube_r285_g3d_r762__It_s_a_small__simple_little_room_scene_.jpg)

The scene looks rather plain and dull, but it is also homy and pretty realistic.
It's not anything super cool, but I wanted to make something that looks real,
and I think I did just that.

I'm going to get off now. Total time worked today: 9 hours and 40 minutes.... Wow that is long. In total, then, I worked 9 hours and 40 minutes plus 5 hours and 35 minutes, which is 15 hours and 15 minutes.


2016-09-11 @ 10:42PM: The Chair and Desk
=============================================================

![Chair and Desk to be Populated](2016-09-11_002_cube_r211_g3d_r762__Chair_and_Desk_to_be_Populated.jpg)

I got a chair and desk. Originally I was going to make an entire desktop rig, but I think I will just recreate the Cornell Box but make it like a tiny study lounge. It will look simple, sure, but pretty realistic too. Kind of like a real scene from a low-budget game, hopefully.


2016-09-11 @ 9:32PM: Cornell
=============================================================

![My Cornell Box](2016-09-11_001_cube_r211_g3d_r762__My_Cornell_Box.jpg)

Alright, so I finished this a lot earlier, but I wanted to get a picture of this
now, before I forgot. The Cornell Box itself was easy to construct, but the lighting is what took me forever. I worked for a couple of hours just trying to figure out how to get the lighting to work. I checked the scene in G3D again and figured out that it uses multiple lights, and then checked the code to find this to be true. I'll remember to check scenes when I am allowed to more often.



2016-09-11 @ 8:34PM: The Staircase Works!
=============================================================

![I have a spiral staircase](2016-09-11_000_cube_r211_g3d_r762__I_have_a_spiral_staircase.jpg)

I finally created a spiral staircase that looks good enough to submit! I'll have to remember
to use Translations to get the spiral to come out like this. There are definitely other ways, but this was definitely the easiest I could think of. 



2016-09-11 @ 3:50PM: The Cube - Day 2 (or 3, if you want to count yesterday)
=====================================================

About to start working. It is currently 3:50PM. I need to finish up this lighting and then start on the stairs and my custom scene.


2016-09-10: The Cube - Day 2 (or 3, if you want to count yesterday)
=====================================================

About to start working. It is currently 5:25PM. Let's see how long I can last, and how far I can go.

EDIT: I stopped working today at 11:45PM. I decided to go and get food, since I didn't really eat dinner. I managed to finish the Cornell Box itself, but now I have to figure out the lighting. I have tried looking at the other scene, but it just doesn't all add up. The light I put faces the backwall without rotation, and when I face it down, the back wall doesn't light up like in the actual scene. It also just looks really weird on the bottom. I think it's just too bright, so I'll lower the brightness, and see what I can figure out tomorrow. 

Total time worked today: 5 hours and 35 minutes....


2016-09-08: The Cube - Day 1
=====================================================

It has begun, but I won't be working on it today. Tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow!	

                 2016-08-12: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press F4 or F6 in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to 
this development journal.
