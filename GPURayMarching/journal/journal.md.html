2016-11-07: Intersection Problem
=============================================================

This is my tank. Woot

The Tracks need work, but this definitely looks like a tank

Aye a turret!

![](2016-11-07_003_gpu-trace_r2122_g3d_r974__.jpg)
My first attempt at a turret. I am not doing this right yet.

![Yup definitely the tracing function](2016-11-07_001_gpu-trace_r2122_g3d_r974__Yup_definitely_the_actualy_function.jpg)
I can now interesect! It was my function that was off sadly

Turns out my box is probably wrong, because I can intersect other primitives.


I cannot seem to intersect Boxes. This is a problem, since boxes are really necessary for what I want to build. A tank!

2016-11-06: Added light stuff
=============================================================

I Can Rotate!

It looks as though my repetition is close, but definitely still incorrect. I can only see things from one side. 
Edit: I managed to get it sort of fixed. There are still many bugs when used, but I have changed my code too much to use it anymore.
![](union.jpg)

union is definitely right.

A transformation gone wrong. Gotta work on these. forgot what I was doing, but its definitely not right.


![The wheel came out to this](batman.jpg)
So the wheel from graphics codex does not work. I don't know why, and I can't seem to find code anywhere to correct it. Oh well. Wheel will go. The batman sign looks cool though!

Currently, the light I have seems to be going out or being reflected off of
items in waves. It seems to be the lerp function doing it, but Idk what I need
to do to fix it yet. It could poentially look cool as a desk lamp light tho. 

I fixed this! It was just a bug with my epsilon. Looks good now :).

I added some new light stuff and can now combined objects, woot! The light looks cool, especially since my surfels now have more than just matte colors.

I worked a long time on getting the shading correct. I followed Julia Goldman's (jsg1@williams.edu) notes from class, because mine were not complete, but when I got down to the shading portion I misread her notes. What I ended up doing incorrectly subtracting from the z value of my normals, which originally looked something like 

surfel.normal = normalize(Vector3(
                estimateDistance(Q + Vector3(epsilon,0,0)), 
                estimateDistance(Q + Vector3(0,epsilon,0)), 
                estimateDistance(Q + Vector3(0,0,epsilon)) - estimateDistance(Q)));

Because her notes had float subtraction, and it looked like the above, I went with it, but I always had odd results. I looked at the graphics codex code, and it also looked very similar, except that it used a Vector3(d,d,d) in the subtraction. The structure, however, was the same as above. It took me a bit, and then I realized that the graphics codex was just missing the parent after the z value, and the vector was being subtracted from the one being created using distances. This made it work straight away once I fixed it.

Code that I used for the test operations. Figured I would keep it saved here.

  // Create a CheckerBoard
    float x = mod(gl_FragCoord.x,32);
    float y = mod(gl_FragCoord.y,32);
    bool lessX = x < 16;
    bool lessY = y < 16;
    if( (lessX && lessY) || (!lessX && !lessY)){
        pixelColor = Color3(1,1,1);
    } else {
        pixelColor = Color3(0,0,0);
    }

 Color3 blue = Color3(0.2,0.21,0.785);
        Color3 white = Color3(1,1,1);
        pixelColor = lerp(blue, white, clamp(noise(gl_FragCoord.xy/60, 3), 0, 1));
